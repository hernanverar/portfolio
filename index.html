         <h3><p><em>About Hernan Verar</em></p></h3>

           <p>I'm formerly a General Contractor with over 20 years of experience. The second week of December, I shut down business to begin this new journey. Born in Mexico, I left my family at the age of 17 to come to the U.S. to embark on my first big journey. I went from working at KFC knowing little to no English to having my own construction company. Now I feel that it is time to move to the next chapter. It's a big change, I know it will be a challenge but I'm happy to be in this program.</p>

           <p>My first week at Epicodus has been hard but fun. Since I'm switching careers, it has been a steep learning curve but having my classmates support has made my week a lot easier. They don't call it a <em>bootcamp</em> for no reason!

           I have lots of hobbies including snowboarding, mountain biking, surfing, working on house projects and sprinter van projects, although I think it will be hard to do anything else other than coding for the next few months.  
           
        <h3><p><em>Goals for the next 27 weeks:</em></p></h3>
