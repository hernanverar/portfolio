  <h3> About Hernan Verar:</h3></h>
         <p>I'm a 43 year old General construction contractor worker for over 18 years, the second week of december shut down bussines to start in this new journey. As immigrated mexican arriving to this country going from not speaking the lenguage to having my own construction company I feel that is time to move to the next chapter. I feel that  by now l have done most of the trades on how to build a house (I have bulid lots of houses) and now imjust exited and happy to be in this program.</p>

           <p>My first week at epicodus it's been fun, but most of the time I feel like I'm falling behind and i'ts understandable they don't called Bootcamp for a reason.
           I have lots of hoobies snowboard, mountain biking, surfing, working on house and sprinter van projects although i think will be hard in next few monts.  Goals for the next 27 weeks I would love to finnish the program  plus I'm super lucky all my fellow students have been super helpful
